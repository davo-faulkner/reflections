When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are not working on your own computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When you are working on the same branch with someone else.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: GitHub only, clones: remote or local, branches: wherever parent commit resides.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that you can work offline (still a little fuzzy on the benefits).

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Given the features and flexibility of Git and GitHub, I can't imagine trying to collaborate without them... especially from remote locations.
